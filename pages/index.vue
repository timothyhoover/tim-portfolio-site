      | I’m currently based in Madrid, Spain as a software developer for Topic Talk Inglés
      | and a freelance web developer. I’ve worked with social media influencers as their
      | web developer (UX/UI) and design consultant and independent real estate companies building
      | web solutions for their portfolios. Most recently I’ve been developing learning applications
      | and interactive environments for Topic Talk Inglés and have found a passion for e-learning.

      | new languages with my favorite apps Busuu, Memorise and Rosetta Stone.
